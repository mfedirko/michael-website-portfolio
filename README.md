This is a full-stack developer portfolio and the source code for [my website](link tbd).

## Local Development
#### Initial Setup
1. Install JDK 17 or higher (if using Intellij, you can [download a JDK within the IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/tips/download-jdk/))
2. Install [Docker and Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
3. Install [Node.js and NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

#### Development
1. Run the main class `src/main/java/com/helloworld/BackendApplication.java`
   1. **VM Options:** `-Dspring.profiles.active=local -Dspring.devtools.restart.enabled=true`
2. Restart and live reload should be triggered by recompiling/rebuilding Java classes and by saving static files 
([docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools.livereload))
