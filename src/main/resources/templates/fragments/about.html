    My interest in programming developed during my Junior year studying Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
    Software development has certain parallels with solving Physics problems -
    analysis of complex systems, deductive reasoning, creativity and a mix between abstract and practical.
    The field of software development continues to amaze me with both the breadth of the technology landscape
    and the depth of its most difficult problems.
    There is no limit to how much you can learn as a software developer.
